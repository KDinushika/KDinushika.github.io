<p align="center">JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

JavaScript is easy to learn.


JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive.It is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.</p><center>

<h5>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. </h5>
